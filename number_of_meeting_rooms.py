Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

Given a list of meetings that will happen during a day, find the minimum number of meeting rooms that can fit all meetings.

Each meeting will be represented by a tuple of (start_time, end_time), where both start_time and end_time will be represented by an integer to indicate the time. start_time will be inclusive, and end_time will be exclusive, meaning a meeting of (0, 10) and (10, 20) will only require 1 meeting room.

Here's some examples and some starting code:

def meeting_rooms(meetings):
  # Fill this in.

# print 1
print(meeting_rooms([(0, 10), (10, 20)]))
# 1

print(meeting_rooms([(20, 30), (10, 21), (0, 50)]))
# 3 (all meetings overlap at time 20)

def meeting_rooms(meetings):
  meetings.sort()

  max_rooms = 0
  meeting_end = []

  for meeting in meetings:
    # pop all meetings that end before the current meeting starts
    while meeting_end and meeting_end[0] <= meeting[0]:
      heapq.heappop(meeting_end)

    heapq.heappush(meeting_end, meeting[1])

    max_rooms = max(max_rooms, len(meeting_end))

  return max_rooms

# print 1
print(meeting_rooms([(0, 10), (10, 20)]))
# 1

print(meeting_rooms([(20, 30), (10, 21), (0, 50)]))
# 3 (all meetings overlap at time 20)
