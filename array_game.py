"""
Two approaches:
    - The first one would be travessing the elements and increasing all elements
    except the largest element until all elements became equals.
    
    But this approach is bad because we woud have a time complexity O(nË†2)
    
    - The second one was doing the inverse path, decreasing the largest elements, so we dont need increse the 
    smallest elements anymore. The mathematic formula is: Sum(Arr) - n * smallestElement.
