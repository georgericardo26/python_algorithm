A Graph is a non-linear data structure consistinf of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices
and the edges are lines os arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
Graph is a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of edges wich connect a pair of nodes.

V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
E = {01, 12, 23, 34, 04, 14, 13}

Graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. Graphs are used to represent networks.
The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. Graphs are also used in social networks
like linkedin, Facebook. for example, in faceboo, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). Each node is a
structure and contains information like person id, name, gender, locale, etc.

The following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph.
1. Adjacency Matrix
2. Adjacency List
There are other representations also like, Incidence Matrix and Incidence List. The choice of graph representation is
situation-specific. It totally depends on the type of operations to be performed and ease of use.
