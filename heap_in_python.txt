Heap in Python
Advertisements. Heap is a special tree structure in which each parent node is less than or equal to its child node.
Then it is called a Min Heap. If each parent node is greater than or equal to its child node then it is called a max heap.

Functions to carry out various operations on heap data structure
    - heapfy: This function converts a regular list to a heap. In the resulting heap the smallest element gets pushed
    to the index position 0.
    - heappush: This function adds an element to the heap without altering the current heap.
    - heappop - This function returns the smallest data element from the heap.
    heapreplace: This function replaces the smallest data element with a new value supplied in the function.
